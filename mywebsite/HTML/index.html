      <center><h2>Purpose</h2></center>
      <p>From a young age, I was captivated by the ethereal melodies that came from stringed instruments. The gentle yet powerful sounds produced by orchestral instruments told stories of their own, written by the composer. 
      Each measure of notes displayed emotions that those with a love for music can understand. Playing one of those instruments was a dream of mine that came true twelve years into my life.</p>
  
      <p>Playing an instrument in an orchestra is a treasured memory I will never forget. Learning technical skills, such as vibrato, intonation, and bowing are not easy work. These skills on their own take a lot of practice
      and overwriting of previous mistakes. Along with technical skills, learning individual pieces of music is no easy task. I created this website to not only share my love for stringed instruments, but also to shine light
      on the dedication and years of hard work it takes to play an instrument.</p>

      <p>Some of my favorite YouTube orchestral cover pages include:

   <div id="music">
      <p>While being in an orchestra, we played songs from several different composers from several different time periods. One of my favorite composers is Tchaikovsky. I find his music to be really enjoyable to play, with fun, fast rhythms and bold dynamics. Another one of my favorites is Vivaldi.
      Not only does he have several iconic pieces, but I find them fun and whimsical both to play as well as to listen to. <a href="tableau.html">Click to see a chart of the number of pieces that US orchestras performed in 2019-2020 by Composer.</a> Not surprisingly, the most iconic composers of this world stay the most iconic.
      I find it fun to look at which composer's music is played the most, and who is more underrated. Although I enjoyed playing artists from iconic composers, it is also fun to play less-known songs.
