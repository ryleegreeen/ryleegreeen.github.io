      <center><h1>Purpose</h1></center>
      <p>From a young age, I was captivated by the ethereal melodies that came from stringed instruments. The gentle yet powerful sounds produced by orchestral instruments told stories of their own, written by the composer. 
      Each measure of notes displayed emotions that those with a love for music can understand. Playing one of those instruments was a dream of mine that came true twelve years into my life.</p>
  
      <p>Playing an instrument in an orchestra is a treasured memory I will never forget. Learning technical skills, such as vibrato, intonation, and bowing are not easy work. These skills on their own take a lot of practice
      and overwriting of previous mistakes. Along with technical skills, learning individual pieces of music is no easy task. I created this website to not only share my love for stringed instruments, but also to shine light
      on the dedication and years of hard work it takes to play an instrument.</p>
